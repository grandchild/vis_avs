/**
 * A multi-threaded caching auto-looping player class for video files.
 *
 * Load the video instance from the filename and optionally set backward and forward
 * cache sizes. Note that `max_cache_length` is the _complete_ cache, and
 * `backward_cache_length` is only the number of past frames to keep. So with the
 * default of 128 & 64 respectively, 128 total frames will be cached, with 64 frames
 * behind and 64 frames ahead of the current `play_head`. The current frame is
 * considered part of the forward cache, so `max_cache_length` needs to be at least 1,
 * but a minimum of 2 forward frames is recommended. Values less than 1 for
 * `max_cache_length` and 0 for `backward_cache_length` will be silently clamped to 1
 * and 0 respectively!
 *
 * The output format of the frame is dependent on the arguments to `get_frame()`. You
 * can set the required size and pixel format as well as the resampling mode used for
 * scaling.
 *
 * Note that the video frame image data may sometimes be upside down. `copy()` and
 * `copy_with_aspect_ratio()` will take care of this for you, if it is the case.
 *
 * You can use the `cache_state()` method to inspect the current cache state.
 *
 * If AVS was compiled with NO_FFMPEG this class' functions will do nothing and return
 * errors.

     * Sets the playback head of the video to `frame_index` and returns a pointer to

     * is freed later after you request a frame further ahead than the
     * `backward_cache_length` you set when you created the `AVS_Video` instance.
     *
     * Moving the playback head forward affects the cache: Old frames further back from
     * the head than `backward_cache_length` will be discarded and new frames will be
     * added to the cache, up to a total of `max_cache_length` (including the backward
     * cache).
     *
     * Moving the playback head backwards (within the range of the backward cache),
     * doesn't affect the cache: Previous frames aren't prepended to the backward cache
     * (as video codecs aren't optimized for decoding backwards), and the forward cache
     * doesn't shrink.
     *
     * Moving the playback head outside of the potential cache range will reset the
     * cache completely and the video file will be seeked to the approximate location of
     * the frame. Check the `timestamp_ms` value of the frame to check the actual
     * returned frame.
     *
     * If `clamp_to_cache` is true, requesting a frame will only return frames from the
     * cache. The playback head will be clamped to the end or the beginning of the cache
     * (whichever is nearer) if `frame_index` is outside the cached range. This is
     * useful if you want to add a lot of jitter to your video playback, but still keep
     * the framerate high by avoiding seeking and waiting for frames to be decoded.
     *
     * If `width ≤ 0` and `height ≤ 0` then the result will have the original video's
     * frame size. If only one of `width ≤ 0` or `height ≤ 0` is true the result will be
     * resized to fit this dimension while preserving the aspect ratio of the original.
     * If both are > 0 `frame` will be resized to match, potentially stretching the
     * image.
     *
     * `get_frame()` is not thread-safe. Retrieve frames from a single thread or
     * synchronize carefully. The decoding is already done in a background thread so
     * there should be no speed gains by retrieving frames in parallel.
     *
     * Returns NULL on error. Have a look at the `error` message of the video instance
     * to find out what's wrong.
