# Set the toolchain target-triplet (<arch>-<vendor>-<os>) and the path prefix for the
# toolchain. We want to target 32bit Windows, and use MingW-w64 for this. For most
# Linux distros MingW-w64 is the default Win32 cross-compiler toolchain.
# 
# Normally you'd only have to edit these two variables here, if at all. Refer to your
# distros documentation on how to set up a Linux-to-Windows cross-compiler, and check
# for their naming convention.
#
# Check if your CROSS_CC_NAME is correct by trying to directly
# execute
#     /usr/bin/CROSS_CC_NAME-gcc
#     (e.g.: /usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-gcc)
# If you get an error like "no input files, compilation terminated" then that's the
# correct setting.
#
# Check if your CROSS_CC_PREFIX is correct by checking whether the file
#     CROSS_CC_PREFIX/bin/libstdc++-6.dll
#     (e.g.: /usr/i686-w64-ming32/bin/libstdc++-6.dll)
# exists.

# i.e. CROSS_CC_NAME, defined above.
